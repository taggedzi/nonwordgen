# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help keep this project secure.

This project is maintained by a single developer. I care deeply about writing safe, secure software, but my availability can vary. There may be long periods where I am unable to check email or respond to issues. Please keep this in mind when reporting any security concern.

Despite this, I genuinely appreciate responsible disclosure and will address issues when I am able.

## 🛡 Supported Versions

Security fixes will generally be applied to:

- The latest released version  
- The main development branch  

Older versions may or may not receive updates depending on severity and feasibility.

## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not disclose security issues publicly** until we have discussed them privately.

To report a potential vulnerability, contact me at:

- **Email:** `taggedzi.mpc@gmail.com`  
  (This is the same public email associated with my other GitHub projects.)

If email is not possible for you, you may open a GitHub issue with *only a minimal high-level description* and request a private way to follow up.

When reporting, please include when possible:

- A short description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept  
- The potential impact  
- Any suggested fixes (optional but appreciated)

## ⏱ Availability & Response Expectations

Because this project is maintained by **one person** and my ability to work varies:

- I may not be able to reply quickly  
- Sometimes I may be unavailable for weeks or even a month  
- When I am able to work, I will always treat security concerns with priority and respect  

A reasonable expectation is:

- **Acknowledgment:** within 2–4 weeks (may be sooner, may occasionally be longer)  
- **Investigation & resolution:** when my health and availability permit  

If you do not receive a reply after several weeks, feel free to send a gentle follow-up.

## 🧭 Scope

This policy applies to:

- The code in this repository  
- Packaged builds and releases derived from it  

Third-party dependencies are outside this project’s control, but reports about risky dependencies are still welcome.

---

## 🤝 Good-Faith Security Research

I appreciate good-faith security research. When testing:

- Avoid actions that could harm others  
- Avoid submitting exploit details publicly  
- Avoid disruptive automated scanning  

If you privately disclose an issue in good faith, you will be treated respectfully regardless of severity.
